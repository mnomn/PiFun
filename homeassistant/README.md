# homeassistant

My config for home assistant

Install in venv
https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/virtualenv/
to ~/fun/hass_env

Update to new venv, since update always fails so bad :(

All installations use config in ~/.homeassistant



OLD:
Install with "sudo pip3 install homeassistant"
Create service file: ./generate-service.sh -u $(which hass)

Default port 8123
